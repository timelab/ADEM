== Will we use the physical on/off switch of the ESP8266 Thing ?

This is unclear yet. We might add this, but it will not be part of the Minimal Viable Product.


== How will the temperature, humidity and pressure sensors get outside information ?

The casing cannot be completely sealed to get usable humidity and pressure readings. However, we would like to have a water-resistant device to avoid internal condensation and/or rust. It definitely has to sustain all weather conditions. *TBD*


== Can we still make changes to the PCB design ?

At the moment changes to the PCB design are possible. Once we order the first batch of PCB printers, we have to be careful in making new changes.


== What are the essential parts for a release ?

The Minimal Viable Product would consist of the following sensors and compontents:

 - Accelerometer sensor
 - GPS
 - Humidity sensor
 - Barometer sensor
 - Particulate matter sensor

In future revisions (betas) we expect the following additional components:

 - I2C memory
 - Battery
 - Buzzer
 - Bluetooth (unlikely, WIFI and serial should be sufficient)
 - Casing


== Is the JSON interface to the back-end service already defined ?

Not in detail.

We already established that sensor-records will be stored in memory in binary form in a ring-buffer. When the device is not moving, a WIFI fix is obtained and records are uploaded (and buffer emptied). These records will store sensor id information, timing and sensor data. Since the GPS frequency is intermitted with sensor data the records can be properly timestamped.

This ensures efficient use of scarce memory, while retaining augmented information to the back-end.

== Will the project make use of the newer and faster ESP32 ?

The ESP8266 has its limits. We have ran into problems with the amount of RAM and the available number of I/O pins. In the current stage of the project we are using a secondary processor (AVR) as a serial-to-I2C bridge for the GPS. This could probably be eliminated when switching to ESP32.
